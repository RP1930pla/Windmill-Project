## Intended use
I published the project here as an example for the **people that might be interested in hiring me** as a **technical artist**.

### Extra content
The project features experimental features of **Anima**, my new environment toolset that I'm creating for environment artists to define quickly the mood of a scene.

Experimental features:
- Exponential Height Fog
- Simple Shell Texture clouds
